# dataStructures-Algorithms

JavaScript algorithms are a set of programming instructions, known as inputs and outputs, that allow a data operation to function precisely at every execution. Meanwhile, JavaScript data structures are a method of organizing and storing data in a computer for efficient access and modification when necessary. A data structure contains the collection of data values, the operations that can be applied to the data and the relationships that exist between each piece of data.

## How Do Data Structures and Algorithms Work Together?
There are many algorithms for different purposes. They interact with different data structures in the same computational complexity scale. Think of algorithms as dynamic underlying pieces that interact with static data structures.

The way data is expressed in code is flexible. Once you understand how algorithms are built, you can generalize across different programming languages. In a sense, it’s a bit like knowing how a related family of languages work syntactically. Once you glimpse the fundamental rules behind programming languages and their organizing principles, you can more easily switch between the different languages and learn each faster.

## Common Data Structures and Algorithms
Common data structures you’ll see across different programming languages include:

1. Linked lists
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Sets
5. Maps
6. Hash tables
7. Search trees

Each of these has its own computational complexity for associated functions like adding items and finding aggregate measures such as the mean for the underlying data structure.

## Some common categories of algorithms are:

1. Search
2. Sorting
3. Graph/tree traversing
4. Dynamic programming
5. Hashing and regex (string pattern matching)
